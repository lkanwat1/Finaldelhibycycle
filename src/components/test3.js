I felt an excellent confidence in Priyam as the lead guide ‚Äì clearly, his knowledge is thorough. He was also very kind and fun to chat to ‚Äì we stopped a couple of times for tea and breakfast, and both times it was extremely interesting to talk to him and get onto topics about India that you need to talk to locals about. Though I was a bit scared of cycling in Delhi traffic, Priyam and Raju took care of us throughout ‚Äì they make sure at every junction that it‚Äôs clear for you and co-ordinate well with each other, Priyam at the front and Raju in the rear. Most of the path was cycle lanes and small streets. If you are an adventurous type and enjoy exercise not sitting like a passive tourist, you will love this tour and enjoy the warmth and expertise of its guides.",

    "Behind every historical capital, there is a great river. The route is an ode to this river that has been a silent witness to Delhi‚Äôs history and is now a recurrent victim of its excesses. Starting from the little lanes of Shahjahanabad, while the city is still sleepy in its proverbial stocks passing along the magnificently formidable walls of the Red Fort we find ourselves on the meditative quiet banks of the Yamuna at Nigambodh Ghat. A visit to the famous ghats ‚Äì     migratory birds circling above the calm waters ‚Äì unravels the ritualistic devotion with which the Hindus treat the historic river.",
    "Despite its current struggles with pollution, the Yamuna is a goddess to the eyes of her devotees. Concluding with a memorable view of the Jama Masjid back through the streets of Old Delhi, the Yamuna Route is a true experience in the stimulating contradictions that is India.",

Completely excited to have found a place like this just behind the magnificent Red Fort. Not that I was the first one‚Ä¶.Nigambodh Ghat is the ancient cremation ground where life and death have been together for centuries. It‚Äôs one of the places where the many souls of Delhi are buried. <br/>Including the Yamuna into the tour, the experience was an opportunity to share the different stories and angles of this important Delhi lifeline. The religious importance (worshipped river by Hindus) as well as the environmental aspect. Showing the beauty of the river also means informing our participants (you üôÇ about the pollution level. It‚Äôs our contribution to making the Yamuna healthy again. By spreading awareness. And giving you an into depth experience of the soul of Delhi.",

        "(Yamuna Tour) Though Id been in Delhi for a few days this trip was an amazing way to see the City. The guides Noem & Pramlad were very passionate & knowleagable about the city. Though the roads in Delhi are an adventure & experience in itself I always felt that we were in safe hands and seeing this great City slowly awake & come to life was a truly memorable time in the city. It was just over 5 1/2 miles of cycling and so not a demanding effort & yet it allowed to cover more of the city but still very much 'be part of it'.",

    "The Shah Jahan Tour is DelhiByCycle‚Äôs classic recipe for an exhilarating glimpse into the life and times of the great Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan and the 1500 acre expanse of his capital ‚Äì Shahjahanabad. At the time of its construction in the 17th Century, it was arguably, the most prosperous and beautiful city in the world. On this Old Delhi bike tour, you will see glimpses of the past",
    "Today, when you pass through its four-hundred-year-old web of alleys held together with great big meshes of electric cables and infused with the smell of brewing tea and simmering breakfast curry, you see a mind-boggling co-existence of the past and the future, competing for your attention.",
    "Emerging from this rainforest, thick with traditional architecture- typical of Shah Jahan‚Äôs time, you will find yourself in a Delhi of another time while you also see the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, the Spice Market and tranquil Civil Lines, the former British colonial area as a sharp contrast to hectic Old Delhi.",
    "This Old Delhi bike tour is here to give you all these experiences. Come to experience Old Delhi with our Shah Jahan tour.",

      "Great choice! The Shah Jahan tour is our classic Old Delhi route, all highlights of Shah Jahanabad are included and much more. Also the tour it all started with. At that time, we are talking about 2009, I was still working as the South Asia correspondent for De Telegraaf (Netherlands‚Äô daily newspaper). <br/> Looking for a new challenge in life, I started exploring Old Delhi on a bike. It was a total blast! The best experience I ever had. So many impressions, colors, smells, beautiful faces, amazing architecture and great history. All clustered within the century-old city walls. Not always easy, sometimes difficult how to deal with poverty and local street life. After cycling for two months I finally designed the best possible route. <br/> I gave up my journalism career and jumped into the deep called Delhi By Cycle. A choice I never ever regretted. I hope you will enjoy this tour as much as I did when exploring the streets of Old Delhi.",

His love for the city shines through him that it was impossible for it not to start rubbing on you as well. He has great knowledge of India and has even gone out of his way to book us train tickets.

Priyam and Mukesh were amazing guides, and they really brought me on an adventure. This is not some typical road-riding trip -we literally bumped shoulders with the locals as we tore through the ancient back-alleys. It felt like an off-roading experience at one point as we went through cobbled roads and potholes! The chai (tea) break by the roadside and breakfast at Karim‚Äôs really capped it off.",

I came to the book market lane and found this 400-year-old city big chaos but still working, saw people from all over India, street food, colors, frames, and whatnot. This street is not just about chaos but stories, a fusion of religions and cultures, big business and traders, and yet peace in the middle of all this.",

        "We did this on the 6th of October. Our guide, Jessvin was waiting for outside Lal Qila Metro Gate 1 at 4pm‚Ä¶. after taking us through different lanes which were bursting with chiarascuro of colours and smells and sounds, he found pockets of silence where he took us through the history of Chandni Chowk. He showed us the Khari Baoli and the different spots mentioned on the tour itinerary.. We sampled some delicious Delhi 6 cuisine, Jalebi, Mutter Samosa, Nan Khatai and chai‚Ä¶ Jessvin ended the tour on a sombre note at the Sisganj Gurudwara.. He went one step further and took us to Jama Masjid to show the famous Karims and Qureshi Kabab Wala which we absolutely loved‚Ä¶ now this tour was done by the 4 of us‚Ä¶ out of which my husband and me have lived in Gurgaon for almost 3 years‚Ä¶ I doubt we could have done justice to the wonder of Chandni Chowk the way Jessvin showed us around‚Ä¶ it was amazing and we want to thank him for being such a patient and a wonderful guide.",

Our friends live in Delhi and we were visiting from Chennai, so even though we are sort of local, it was great having an experienced person telling us the stories and showing us the sights. The food stops were fabulous - I‚Äôm still dreaming about the peas samosas at Old famous jalebi shop. At the end of the tour, Jeswin gave us some great suggestions for dinner and we absolutely loved the kababs at qureshi. We will be back in Delhi in a few months and hope to go on the bicycle tour next.",

        "The DBC street food safari is an up-and-close experience of Delhi. We met at the Red Fort metro station and from there dove straight into the busy streets of Delhi. We started with a delicious samosa at a place that has been doing samosas for many years. My guides were incredibly kind and very knowledgeable. They told stories about the history of buildings, of foods, of streets... We did not only go from one food place to the next but also made the time to visit temples and other beautiful places such as old havelis. The foods ranged from savoury snacks to sweets, and ended with a proper mouth-freshening pan (no worries, this did not include tobacco, just the taste explosion of many different ingredients such as anise seeds and rose water and coconut and more). I totally loved the dal kachori with its crispiness and juiciness at the same time. Definitely worth it!",

        "I took the Delhi-Agra cycle tour, which was an amazing way to really experience the country in many different facets. We started by driving out of Delhi for two hours, followed by a breakfast of delicious tandoor-cooked parathas. Then we started cycling through the villages, with explanations about Krishna‚Äôs life by our knowledgeable guides. We visited temples and had proper chai and lassi, and were greeted by many curious locals who wanted to talk to us and hang out with us. We ended the first day by visiting a puja on the river and then had some local street food. We slept really well after that outdoor-day, and the next morning went to Agra by car. There we visited Taj Mahal, followed by another delicious local breakfast of puri, and cycled through the craziness of Agra. This was a whole different experience, and was very rich in colour and sound. After all this, we drove back to Delhi. I felt very safe with the experienced guides, who were also to fix any bicycle problems. They also really focused on details, including taking some pictures of the guests while cycling (see example below). Finally, I think this company really takes great care of its guides, which is also worth supporting. So, this is a fantastic way to see Taj Mahal and experience India.",

        "I took the Delhi-Agra cycle tour, which was an amazing way to really experience the country in many different facets. We started by driving out of Delhi for two hours, followed by a breakfast of delicious tandoor-cooked parathas. Then we started cycling through the villages, with explanations about Krishna‚Äôs life by our knowledgeable guides. We visited temples and had proper chai and lassi, and were greeted by many curious locals who wanted to talk to us and hang out with us. We ended the first day by visiting a puja on the river and then had some local street food. We slept really well after that outdoor-day, and the next morning went to Agra by car. There we visited Taj Mahal, followed by another delicious local breakfast of puri, and cycled through the craziness of Agra. This was a whole different experience, and was very rich in colour and sound. After all this, we drove back to Delhi. I felt very safe with the experienced guides, who were also to fix any bicycle problems. They also really focused on details, including taking some pictures of the guests while cycling (see example below). Finally, I think this company really takes great care of its guides, which is also worth supporting. So, this is a fantastic way to see Taj Mahal and experience India.",

      "Hot, spicy, sweet, grilled, fried, sugar dipped, baked, or whatever your type of taste is, Old Delhi is for you. The food history of this area is going all the way to early 900 AD and it is a good fusion of Persian, Arab, and Indian style. Some shops here are as old as 150 years and we lost quite a few with the partition of India. I personally started diving deep in the taste of Old Delhi during my university days and now it‚Äôs a pleasure to pick some of the best for you and let our team take you on a street food safari.",

        "I took the Delhi-Agra cycle tour, which was an amazing way to really experience the country in many different facets. We started by driving out of Delhi for two hours, followed by a breakfast of delicious tandoor-cooked parathas. Then we started cycling through the villages, with explanations about Krishna‚Äôs life by our knowledgeable guides. We visited temples and had proper chai and lassi, and were greeted by many curious locals who wanted to talk to us and hang out with us. We ended the first day by visiting a puja on the river and then had some local street food. We slept really well after that outdoor-day, and the next morning went to Agra by car. There we visited Taj Mahal, followed by another delicious local breakfast of puri, and cycled through the craziness of Agra. This was a whole different experience, and was very rich in colour and sound. After all this, we drove back to Delhi. I felt very safe with the experienced guides, who were also to fix any bicycle problems. They also really focused on details, including taking some pictures of the guests while cycling (see example below). Finally, I think this company really takes great care of its guides, which is also worth supporting. So, this is a fantastic way to see Taj Mahal and experience India.",

        "I‚Äòve enjoyed the two days cycle trip from Delhi to Agra very much. With both my tour guides I cycled through open green fields, saw beautiful small ponds and some very cute villages in Krishna‚Äòs home region. They have entertained me with many stories about the region, the customs of the area (like an evening aarti next to a river) and spoiled me for choice of food.",
        "Cycling through the old part of Agra has been exciting and impressive. The visit of the Taj Mahal was the highlight of my stay in India and has been an incredible experience. Thank you!",

        "Let me start by saying this tour is wonderful!!! It‚Äôs everything is says on the website and more. We initially thought it was on the more expensive side but when you break down what you get it is not at all and is worth every penny.",
        "If you want to cycle through the ‚ÄúReal India‚Äù on top notch bikes, eating at wonderful local restaurants (vetted by the guides) and get to visit the Taj Mahal then take this tour.Our guides Jeswin and Ahmer were simply incredible. They were attentive, informed, funny and caring. Their positive outlook on life was wonderful and we left feeling we had not only observed their obvious friendship but had been included in it.",
        "The tour ends with you cycling through Agra amidst cars, tuk tuks, cows, monkeys motorbikes, pedestrians etc. We loved the excitement and bustle of the city but it may take some a little getting used to. Loved the tour and wished it could have been even longer.",
        "A massive thumbs up, would totally recommend.",
