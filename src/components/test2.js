No matter how you plan your life to be but life has it’s own plans for you and Gyan Yatra (GY) was the part of the plan. I was happy to work as an administration person rather than being in the field because till that time I didn’t accept guiding as a serious work for myself, thanks to our societal conditioning! But as I said about life’s plan- one day I received a text from one of our clients that she wanted to visit Agra through GY but unfortunately, she is alone and if possible can we arrange a small Delhi walking tour for her! That was the last minute and I was the only one and saying “No” was not ethical so, I took her to the same tour which my father did for me 16 years before and I ended up with a lifetime memory and a new friend @clair from the Netherlands.

        "Thousands of days ago when nobody dared to think the unthinkable about riding a cycle in the city of Delhi, an idea was ignited to ride the path less ridden. An unknown experience was around the corner, curiosity was killing that cat but with all this, came the most exhilarating sense of something new.",
        "Little did anyone know but the people, whose city was chosen to be explored were in for a surprise, for they never thought the worldly travelers would want to visit them at all. That too on cycles! “Who cycles for leisure in this crowded city” was the burning question in everyone’s mind. Most tourists had by then probably journeyed the small and old cities of India only through books making each create their own imagination, usually far from reality. Or perhaps heard about them in narration by wanderers and seekers who rightly so weave the stories from their own perspective.",
        "And for this reason, the bright idea of giving a cycling tour of lesser known places in Delhi was just. The aim was to give the first-hand experience of the mystical places of Delhi to people on cycles; to slow down when suddenly aroma of spices fills up the air or when the eyes catch an unexpected picturesque flock of birds that change the horizon or simply to get a foothold on the pedal and use their photography skills to capture the marvel architecture of another world.",
        "Besides, with the rise of pollution and serpentine-like traffic jams, Delhi screamed for help for a more environmentally friendly solution on the road. Delhi by Cycle secretly aimed to be the inspiration for city dwellers to adopt cycling as a means of everyday conveyance and in the span of less than a decade, there has been a slow but steady rise in the use of the world’s best two-wheeler invention. Be it for an exercise routine or simply challenging themselves to take DelhibyCycle tours to see their very own city has been nothing less than a feeling of success for the team. With the Indian capital also promoting cycling by installing rental cycles at various junctions, it sure does spark more hope.",
        "The yearning for story-telling, creating memorable moments and healthy living marks the underlying vision of this first family of cycling lovers. As life demands of all to pedal ahead, DelhibyCycle has also started to pedal its wheels to neighboring cities like Agra and Jaipur to further spread the love and joy of its vision. Ironically, going back to the basics of traveling i.e. cycling is making everyone challenge themselves to wheel out of the comfort zone and ride to self-discovery over and over again. And when that happens, and our dear visitors express that they realized something new about life beyond enjoying the cycling adventure on the tour, our mission is flatteringly achieved.",

Director & CEO of DBC, he is literally a jack of all trades and is in love with telling stories, taking pictures, cycles, writing poems. Calls himself a multi-local Indian and can make you fall in love with India. Considers himself an old spiritual soul and famous for his deep talks and poor jokes in close friend circle.

        "The DBC hunters had to solve 4 – Number clues in order to be able to open the treasure chest. A few of them got it right, some of them couldn’t get all the 4 digits, some of them got the numbers wrong. But we are pretty sure that everyone had a great time figuring out these clues and finishing off the tasks given to them.",

So new at times that a region of India seems more than enough to absorb, and one couldn’t fathom that there would be more to offer in this land. The land that promotes unity in diversity but often making many tourists ignore the depth of diversity that we pride ourselves upon.",
        "No one is oblivious to the golden triangle holiday loop of India, the famous Delhi-Jaipur-Agra road trip. This journey makes people see vibrant cities with age-old history and experience the king-size lifestyle led by today’s and yesteryears royalties. Anyone who has been to these places would know that the rural lifestyle here is nothing less than royalty of its own with rich tradition and culture not found anywhere else.",
        "The tradition of music, dance, art, and food that have a long journey of its own is showcased in the most beautiful way that would make people yearn to come back to India. But is it the desire to see more of the same or the hunger for something fresher that India has to offer? Unfortunately, on global tourism network, there isn’t much promotion or details about other Indian cities. We want to bridge this gap of information slowly by sharing just a couple of the different paths that you may consider for your next vacation to the mighty land of gods and goddesses.",
        "Keeping Delhi as the starting point of the journey, from here one can drive up north towards the Himalayan mountain ranges that will bless you with fresh air and greenery. The gigantic ranges of Himalayas have long been the numero uno place to visit for serious explorers from time unknown.",
        "Travel the road from Delhi towards Uttarakhand, then to Himachal Pradesh and stop over at Punjab before finally heading back to Delhi with memories of the meadows, snow peaked mountains, vast greens, religious traditions, varied cultures, sports adventure and the alluring different lifestyles witnessed before bidding adieu until next time.",
        "Far from the maddening crowd is another world that flourishes in the gift of nature. The Himalayan ranges extend its arm all the way to the North East of India which is known as the Seven Sisters and there is also the brother state that is often neglected but only in name under the shadow of the more popular tagline of the sisters.",
        "From being the most ignored region of India, one can arguably state that some of the cleanest villages in Asia are found here. With Manipur once named as The Land of Jewels by a former Prime Minister of India, to Shillong, capital of Meghalaya globally referred to as the Rock (Music) Capital of India to picturesque Arunachal Pradesh giving chills to other valleys, these are just a few drops of an ocean of different world in India. To say the least, it will be heaven for travelers and wanderers.",
        "It won’t be right to not mention that the gastronomic experience in The Diamond Loop and North East India will be nothing short of a delightful surprise, with each state giving you a new taste. One better than the other and the discovery of new cuisines keeps continuing.",
        "True to my words, India doesn’t stop being mesmerizing and surprising. Just as it impossible to travel the length and breadth of the country in one holiday trip, it will be a fool’s ambition to plan to write about all of India’s hidden gems in one article. The never-ending saga of travel tales will continue…",

It doesn’t take a creative eye to notice the incredible gem like remnants of yesteryear havelis peeking out between the not-so-organized urban buildings of today. Just like these beautiful structures from Mughal era standing strong and defiant but silently amidst the never-ending paradigm shift in the neighborhood, the humans of this part of the city also seem to be relaxed, almost seeming lazy, in their own disorderly surroundings.",

Several ancient tombs and mosques are there in the garden compound. Beautiful place to click pictures and relax. I usually cycle to Lodi Garden early morning and jog around over the trek. Khan market is next to Lodi garden, you can visit the market for food, shopping, books or just coffee. Garden also has an exotic restaurant!          ",

        "If you really want to visit an amazing offbeat place in Delhi then you have to visit Mehrauli Archaeological Park (Map)! You can call this place the first Delhi of the modern period. The structures over here are as old as 900 AD with the first true arc of Indian architecture in the tomb of Balban. This whole place is covered with the trees and looks like a mini jungle. More than 5 big and several small monuments in the park to visit, this place has everything to amaze you. Suggested to visit with someone, not alone. It’s good even if you are even two people. Don’t miss the step well known as Rajon Ki Bawoli, Tomb of Quli Khan and several other monuments. MAP is quite near to Qutb Minar (UNESCO World Heritage Site) and you can see it from almost all the monuments of MAP.",

        "Hauzkhas District Park (Map) is home to magnificent ruins of an Islamic school as old as 700 years, a lake, an urban jungle and place to experience the beautiful sunset. Just with somewhere in the ruins and see the sunset over the lake. It is amazing to experience that how that back the school used to accommodate students in hostel dorms with the separate room for students. Hauzkhas is also the place to experience the nightlife of Delhi, with some of the best cafes, bars, and restaurants situated at this place. You can choose to be at anyone after the sunset. Just experience that how two different timelines merge at this point, ancient India and the modern one.",
