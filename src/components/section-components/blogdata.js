Most tourists had by then probably journeyed the small and old cities of India only through books making each create their own imagination, usually far from reality.

And when that happens, and our dear visitors express that they realized something new about life beyond enjoying the cycling adventure on the tour, our mission is flatteringly achieved.",

But if you want to stay in your comfort zone, you are missing out on a lot of things. We don’t want that for you. That is the very reason why we conduct our tours quite early in the morning to avoid that rush and to give you a great experience of Old Delhi. If you are in Delhi, you really don’t want to miss what Old Delhi has to offer! Do you want to hear what one of our clients says? What a great tour! I have been several times in India and also for the 2nd time in Old Delhi. But in a cycle tour a complete different experience. Good we left very early in the morning otherwise we were not able anymore to cycle through the narrow streets in the labyrinth of Old Delhi. Amazing adventure! So the question is, do you want to miss out on an amazing adventure?",

    quote:
      "“Old Delhi by bike? What? Is it even possible?” This is one of the most common questions you get to hear from someone who is new to Delhi. We admit that some Indians and even some local Delhite do have this question in their mind. But our answer to the question – “Can a person with less experience in Delhi, especially if it is a foreigner, cycle around Old Delhi area?”- is a definite YES! Here is why.",

One of the prime duty of our Co-Guide is to protect you from almost anything from that can happen on the road. Here is our guide and co-guide in action",

It doesn’t take a creative eye to notice the incredible gem-like remnants of yesteryear Havelis peeking out between the not-so-organized urban buildings of today.

Jack, Founder of Delhi By Cycle, then reporter of a Dutch Newspaper came up with this beautiful idea to explore Old Delhi on cycles and make others explore the same. And since then Delhi By Cycle has been through a glorious journey of showing Delhi to more than 30000+ people from across the world.",

The richest empire in the world decided to move its capital therefore, they were in need of a completely new city and therefore, Shahjahan decided to construct one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Indeed, this city was one of the most beautiful cities and now one of the most interesting cities in the world. Hence, we named this tour as Shahjahan Tour.",

Team DBC hosted few celebrities, ministers of several nations, few national sports teams of other countries, CEOs of fortune 500, and thousands of beautiful souls. Sharing smiles and stories with them was a beautiful journey for Delhi By Cycle team.",

Shahjahan Tour made a lot of things open to the world, from the hidden secret spice market rooftops(not hidden anymore) to the hidden chai lanes of civil lines. The stories of Chandani Chowk and Sishganj Gurudwara traveled the whole world. Managing through this beautifully organized chaos created a lifetime experience for every single person and people mentioned this in their reviews all the time.",
      "As we are going to celebrate 10 years of Delhi By Cycle and Shahjahan Tour next year. A lot will happen in the year 2019! We would like to invite everyone to experience some special tours of DBC which will only happen in that time period. Bike Tours in Delhi changed forever since Shahjahan Tour was started in 2009. We promise to come up with new ideas to show to real Delhi and India to make to listen to hidden stories and to make to ride the unknown lanes. As smiles can only be shared while traveling slow.",

So, you cannot click pictures inside, which is good in a way, because you will focus completely on the magic created by hands! Everything is so perfect that it is difficult to describe it in words.
